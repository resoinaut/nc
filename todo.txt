* investigate using C23 nullptr instead of NULL where applicable
* investigate using C99 restrict where applicable
* move all error messages to errormessage.h
* consider reworking error handling
* distinguish between errors in code and "fatal" errors, errors in execution
* finish switching _T_ to T in generic vector
* clean code up and search for memory leaks such as when using TRY macro!
* consider the return values of all functions, such as fprintf, etc!
* document all functions
